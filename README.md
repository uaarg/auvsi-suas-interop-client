AUVSI SUAS Interoperability Server Client
===

This is a Python client library for interacting with the AUVSI SUAS Competition's Interoperability server. It is meant to be included (e.g. as a Git submodule) in other projects that require communication with the interoperability server.

This library is based on the one provided in the [official AUVSI SUAS Interoperability server repository](https://github.com/suas-competition/interop).
